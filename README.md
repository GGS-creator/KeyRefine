# KeyRefine
A cyber security project that takes a user-provided password and enhances and modifies it.
The program uses a stack to store and manipulate the characters of the password.
Character Replacement: Vowels and consonants are replaced with predefined special characters or numbers.
Separator Insertion: Random separators are inserted at the beginning or end of the password.
File Saving: The generated password is saved to a text file in the user's specified directory. 
The program checks if the file exists; if it does, it appends the new password; if not, it creates a new file and writes the password.
User Interaction: The program prompts the user to enter a password and the name of the directory where the file should be saved.
PowerShell Command Execution: The program uses PowerShell commands to handle file operations, ensuring compatibility with Windows systems.
